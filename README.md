The goal of my program is to analyze the data and clean it
I have a manager of the data analysis department and a manager of the department that cleans the data
The goal is to get as much clean data as possible so that we can extract information from it
There is a function whose job is to check the tweets for each category
Another function checks the length of the words
Another function that extracts the longest tweets for each category
Another function that extracts the ten words that appear the most often
Another function that returns the number of words with uppercase letters
And all this is saved in a json file
And there is the data cleaning
A function that returns only the information needed
A function that removes punctuation marks
A function that converts to lowercase letters
A function that removes what is not classified
And this is saved in a csv file
